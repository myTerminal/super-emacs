An out-of-the-box Emacs configuration with superpowers.

## A few highlights

- Minimal interface with a more readable font size and a dark theme
- Dual configuration for text-based and graphical modes
- Easier buffer and window navigation and text edits with a range of configured key-bindings
- A custom mode-line with more info
- Key bindings arranged under a few keys to keep the rest of the keys free
- Several tweaks and settings for a better programming experience in multiple languages and to work with projects and named workspaces
- More control over package versioning using [quelpa](https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa)
- Statistical computing with [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) files
- More in [the docs](docs)!
